it's been about 10 years since i've had a working website. i've had the domains for a while but they've just been pointing to my [instagram](http://instagram.com/samdavid). do it for the double tapsssssss.

having a lot of free time lately, i'm starting up again. 

<3s to [my husband](http://codyrobert.com) for suggesting github. i was so happy to find [this nice, clean layout](https://github.com/swanson/lagom).

i got more things rolling out soon too. [sneak peak](http://instagram.com/whiskeyandboardgames)
